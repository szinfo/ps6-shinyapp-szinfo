##Overview of data

As stated in the about page this dataset looks at the temperature as measured by
deviation from the baseline between 1991-2020 in Celcius. This dataset comes 
from UAH, and it contains 14310 total observations with 5 variables, year, 
month, region, temp, then time which is given as the the year with a decimal 
corresponding to the given month. 

## Explanation of Widgets

For the plot page, the first widget is meant to change the visuals of the graph
without changing the data of the plot, so I chose to change the marker shapes of
plot points, giving a couple options for which marker shape you want to chose,
either EXPR(circle), Option_2(triangle), or Option_3(square). Then for the second
widget I chose to allow you to decide which region you would like to plot on the
plot, with all the regions listed as options. The correspond text output lists
the number of observations on the plot. For the tables page, the widget allows you
to select a certain year and see the average temperature for that year, with the
corresponding text output allowing you to see the difference between the oldest
and newest years selected. 

## Exmplanation of Panels

In the first panel, the about, it gives you a little intro into the data set on
the sidebarpanel and then in the mainpanel of the page it gives you a random sample of
data from the dataset, giving you an idea of what data your observing and 
interacting with in the app. The second panel, the plot panel, on the sidebar
panel gives a brief explanation of what the graph on the main panel shows as
well as the two widgets mentioned above for the plots panel then 
main panel shows a graph that plots the temp vs the time in months by region with
interactive text below it showing the number of observations on the plot.
Then finally the last panel, the data table panel, on the sidebar panel, gives a
brief explanation of what the data table on the left shows as well as the widget
mentioned above for the table panel with the data table examining ave temp by
year in the main panel, with reactive text giving you the difference, as explained
previously, above the plot
